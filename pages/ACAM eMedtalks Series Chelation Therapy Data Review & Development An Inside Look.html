1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
So, good evening, everyone, and thank you for attending another ACAMS eMed talk.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:13,320
Today's webinar is chelation therapy data review and development, an inside look with

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,920
Dr. Dorothy Merritt.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:23,920
So, all attendees are encouraged to submit questions via the chat box over to the right.

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,680
Questions will be addressed throughout the presentation with a longer Q&A session at

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,080
the end.

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:35,200
Fans can expect to receive a recording of this presentation within two to three business

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,040
days via email.

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,640
Next, it's my pleasure to announce that we do have a chelation education special currently

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,640
going on.

11
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,240
So, there's going to be 20% off of the basic chelation webinars and protocol.

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,640
So, I'm going to go ahead and be posting that link over to the right in the chat section

13
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,880
along with the discount promo code.

14
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:00,640
So, make sure that everyone here has a chance to sign up if you haven't already and hurry

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,600
up because it will expire on July 3rd, so that's this Friday.

16
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:14,400
So, next, the moderator for today is Dr. Alan Green, board certified family physician currently

17
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,240
in private practice at the Center for Optimum Health in Los Angeles, California.

18
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,400
Dr. Green's practice focuses on areas such as longevity, medicine, immune enhancement

19
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:31,000
and balancing, detoxification and cleansing, neurotransmitter balancing, bioidentical hormone

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,920
replacement therapy, allergy and environmental medicine and nutrition.

21
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,800
Not only is he a past president of ACAM, but also extremely involved in everything we have

22
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,800
going on today.

23
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,440
So, Dr. Green, it's such an honor to have you here and I'll pass it off to you.

24
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:53,480
I know, it sounds like I'm such an underachiever, doesn't it?

25
00:01:53,480 --> 00:02:02,600
It's a pleasure to be here today too and to be moderating this workshop with Dorothy Merritt.

26
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,220
I've known Dorothy many, many years.

27
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:14,320
She's a colleague and a friend and she is one of the experts in chelation medicine in

28
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,660
the United States.

29
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:23,320
She has been an important member of the education team for chelation therapy that ACAM has

30
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,660
had for many years.

31
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:33,680
She's served as the co-chair of the chelation training program and on the chelation committee

32
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,000
for ACAM and she has appointments at universities.

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:47,400
She really knows her chelation and I've been doing chelation 35 years and I still learn

34
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,840
when I listen to, I call her Dot Merritt, Dr. Dot.

35
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:00,640
So with no further ado, I will now introduce you, Dorothy Merritt.

36
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,640
Well thank you.

37
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,040
Let me get my screen up here.

38
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,040
Okay.

39
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:15,520
So tonight, I wanted to do a brief like 15, 20 minutes on where we are with EDTA and the

40
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:23,720
national TAP trials and catch you up on things as far as cardiovascular, renal, and some

41
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,280
new treatment papers on treatment of neuropathies.

42
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,040
And then I'll present a case and I have Betty presenting a case that's very interesting

43
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,840
that we've done several times at the meetings and so with that, I'll get started.

44
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,380
So what's new with EDTA?

45
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:52,160
As you know, EDTA started out being a, after the first world war, they didn't have anything,

46
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:57,280
they couldn't get citric acid from Germany or Germany couldn't get it from England because

47
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,320
they weren't friends anymore and so they had to develop something and they developed EDTA

48
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:08,520
and it was basically to take out the white spots that calcium caused in dying clothes

49
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,080
and cloth.

50
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,920
So it's used in many things, lipstick, your corn flakes, water treatment plants, I mean

51
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,800
it's in your purple top tubes, it's in everything.

52
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:28,040
There's at least 14 different versions that Dow owns but only two are FDA approved for

53
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:34,600
use in humans and so these different chelates have different salts attached to them so that

54
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:41,920
they work at different pHs but for human pH in blood, we use calcium EDTA and disodium

55
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,720
EDTA.

56
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,680
So the initial report on EDTA chelation for coronary disease was in 1956 in a bunch of

57
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:58,520
lead intoxicated Detroit workers and there was a serum dip in this observation in patients

58
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,680
being treated for leg toxicity that their angina went away.

59
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,760
Now remember this is before CCUs, statins, probably aspirin, I mean nobody knew anything

60
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:13,320
except people dropped dead and you know indigestion and which was angina and here was this neat

61
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,040
stuff that when you got treated with lead your angina went away.

62
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:24,680
And so jump ahead or fast forward 60 years and many many many many studies and then you

63
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:31,880
get to the, we funded the NIH funded the trial to assess chelation therapy basically to prove

64
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:38,600
that it didn't work and Tony Longus was the PI, I was one of the PIs on this plan.

65
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,120
And finally after 10 years of enrolling people and it took a long time because everybody

66
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,640
thought you know chelation was fraud and abuse and didn't work and it was silly and all this

67
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,640
kind of stuff.

68
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:55,520
So in January 2013 this landmark study is published and basically without getting too

69
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:02,640
detailed with it there were four arms, the top purple arm was placebo, the bottom was

70
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:08,880
the green arm there is the treatment with EDTA and high dose oral vitamins, these weren't

71
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,960
even high dose IV vitamins they were just high dose oral and then the yellow is just

72
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,240
EDTA by itself the little blue one is just the high dose vitamins and nothing else and

73
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,800
then of course placebo was the purple.

74
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,880
But what I'll point out on this graph is that during the first 12 months most people received

75
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:35,360
their 30 to 40 chelations right and you don't see much divergence of the curve in this case

76
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,160
and it's only about 12 months where you see big divergence and then over the five year

77
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,200
period you can see it diverges quite a bit.

78
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:49,440
Well the very interesting thing about this trial and the way statistics work is that

79
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,120
there were more dropouts there were 17 percent dropout in this trial but it wasn't the people

80
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,440
getting treated it was the people who weren't on treatment they were on the placebo and

81
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,600
most of them had events and they were like tired of getting poked and they said this

82
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,400
isn't working I want to get the real stuff I mean that's basically what happened well

83
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,140
statistically when that happens the curves come closer together.

84
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:16,720
If you have a trial where people drop out of the treatment end the curves diverge even

85
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,740
more so it makes it look like it's better even though it's maybe not.

86
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,600
So anyway I want to point that out then after they got the data and they started looking

87
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:31,040
at the subsets people they noticed that the diabetics diverged the most and I mean really

88
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:36,440
diverged and noticed that they diverged right down there from day one and anybody who does

89
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:41,800
chelation notices that in diabetics they get the biggest bang for their buck and it happens

90
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:48,020
immediately well okay so the bottom line on this study I could go on and on but the bottom

91
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:53,640
line is and this is one of the things I put in my rooms is if you look at EDTA reduced

92
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:58,440
cardiovascular events there's 18 percent if you looked at EDTA with the high dose vitamins

93
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:04,040
it was 26 percent reduction in events and that is on top of all these people had to

94
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:11,040
be on optimal medical therapy so they had to be on their five five drug post heart attack

95
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:16,760
you know regimen and and look at the NMTs on it you know number needed to treat I'll

96
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:21,080
show you where that's really important in a minute but if you look at the diabetics

97
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:26,240
and you get down there to number six which is the EDTA plus high dose vitamins reduced

98
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:34,280
MIs by 51 percent over the five-year period compared to people who were treated with placebo

99
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:40,440
and the number needed to treat was only six so you take six diabetics who are post MI

100
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:46,620
and you treat them and you have a 51 percent reduction in heart attacks and 43 percent

101
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:54,440
reduction of CV mortality 41 percent CV total events but these NMTs are insane you just

102
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,040
don't get those kind of and and here's here's the the side I laminate and I have in all

103
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:05,520
my exam rooms it's the five you know post optimal medical therapy of aspirin beta blocker

104
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:12,000
statin, ACE, and chelation and if you look at that with the 26 percent reduction at a

105
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,760
trial level a and you compare it to all the others look at the NMTs on these other things

106
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,640
the ACE is the stands you know they're 33 to 65 28 42 I mean they're huge and here we

107
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,960
have something that if you get the real deal and you're diabetic and you take the high

108
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:34,960
dose vitamins you have an NMT of six unbelievable and so you would think you know with that

109
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,560
kind of data everybody be real excited but you should have seen the ACC meeting where

110
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:45,000
they announced the preliminary data and I've never seen so much temper tantrums and just

111
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,120
absolute disbelief we must have cheated you know it was it was just really amazing here

112
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:59,560
we have an incredible trial 55,000 IV drips were given 55,000 with nothing like this ever

113
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:07,560
before anyway so because of that it took them two years but the ACC grant chelation now

114
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:13,480
promoted it from class three which means probably doesn't work for to a class to be which is

115
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:19,020
well the usefulness is uncertain but it might work so we're all the way up to that after

116
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:24,720
that huge trial so the FDA said do another trial but this time do it just in diabetics

117
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:33,600
so that too started in 16 they had as of September of last year they had almost 800 people randomized

118
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,880
and of course it closed down because of COVID for the last three months but they're probably

119
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:46,440
up to over 800 850 now and this is also a five-year trial and is focusing on the diabetics

120
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:52,600
so this time it was like well we can't recommend a treatment that we don't know how it works

121
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:58,400
so how is this working well of course people who've been studying EDTA for years knew that

122
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:07,000
it removed metals it reduced inflammation and it did something with nitric oxide I mean

123
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,720
huge huge something and you know your diabetics are really poor in nitric oxide so that's

124
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:17,480
why I think their curve I'll show you why in a little bit why their curve widened right

125
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:24,920
at the beginning because they were the sickest as far as the nitric oxide and then you know

126
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:30,920
by removing the metals over that year you allow basically like hairball in the drain

127
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,760
in your metabolic system to dissolve and then all of a sudden you can start fixing things

128
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:42,280
and so that's when you really see the benefit is that well in all comers the diabetics you

129
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:49,840
see it immediately this if you're interested website is tech2.org and these are the sites

130
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:56,920
right now in the United States and you can see that the diabetic belt and the heavy metal

131
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:05,880
belt over in the the northwest quarter all the way down to the south southeast quarter

132
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,680
is where the majority of diabetics are so this is going to be a good trial there'll

133
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:17,360
be lots of appropriate people so if you're interested in participating or you just want

134
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,600
to refer people you can go to this site and get get the information.

135
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,560
So what they did with the tech2 before they started they did this little poster where

136
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:32,940
they basically took all these people who were appropriate who were you know who could sign

137
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:39,640
up and be part of this trial and they did a chelation challenge on them and basically

138
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:48,900
measure their urine before and after chelation and so what they saw was almost a four thousand

139
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,900
percent increase.

140
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,600
Dr. Merritt real quick sorry to interrupt you could you go back to your web browser

141
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,080
there's a little white window at the bottom of your web browser and we can't see the

142
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:04,880
yeah and I don't know that's that's that this is that hide the hide yep okay there you

143
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,400
okay well that was that was the okay anyway perfect yeah four thousand almost you know

144
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:16,000
four thousand percent lead excretion post EDTA on a first treatment six hundred seventy

145
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
percent on cadmium we'll know that that's CAD and PVD right there and then if you go

146
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:33,000
over to the far right you can see where the the far far right curve by 20 by 20 chelations

147
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,720
the the amount of lead was really down that's actually the wrong graph but anyway the amount

148
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:45,000
of lead was incredibly down just by 20 treatments but of course they were all given 40 and so

149
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:53,800
there was also aluminum and nickel and and I don't know if that's thallium or titanium

150
00:13:53,800 --> 00:14:00,660
but anyway a lot but lead and cadmium are the elephants in the room and so so now we

151
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:07,320
know that you know we're proving one of the things intact too is everybody's getting their

152
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:15,360
you know post excretion metals measured so well and we already know that Cranton published

153
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,880
something way back in his textbook from the 1980s that was updated I think in the 90s

154
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:27,280
that nor in normal people presenting for chelation the amount of lead was eight times higher

155
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:33,680
post challenge so that would be 800 percent but these people are 38 they're almost four

156
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,480
thousand percent increased lead excretion so I think it's going to be very interesting

157
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:48,480
when they show you know the metal metal arrangement here okay so let's see so this is back on

158
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:55,960
tact one and so this is the patients that had coronary disease and PVD and what they're

159
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:00,840
out my name is on this publication so that's why I'm showing it but no but anyway the sicker

160
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:06,600
they are the better the wider that curve was you know as far as how fast it differentiated

161
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:12,680
and the actual reduction in events in these people's 58 percent reduction so pretty pretty

162
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:21,240
impressive for a cheap little generic medication so now attack three is coming so they they

163
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:27,800
decided to start looking at critical limb cases and so this is a case that I think they

164
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:35,560
want some big thing on with the FCC anyway this guy comes in you can see the baseline

165
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:44,720
purple toes he failed a re re you know rasterization procedure and this is his toes up through

166
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:51,440
41 yes the chronic ones are amputated off or auto amputate but look he has no more pain

167
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:58,480
can walk has good quality of life at this point the lower extremity angiograms you can

168
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,880
see where it just cuts off it you know above the ankle there and then down at the bottom

169
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:10,800
the post infusion posterior tibial artery arterial duplex you can see where there's

170
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:18,000
huge improvements in blood flow after the 41 treatments so that's pretty impressive

171
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,320
and so now 3a has started and it published the first seven people that they've done

172
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:32,080
and lovely toes there but again they reported in different ways but it's about four thousand

173
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:39,660
percent increase also in the the amount of lead and cadmium and that's what they mostly

174
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:47,200
focused on this one and you can see that the post chelation levels of urinary lead in that

175
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:53,280
middle slide on the far right they start from baseline and by by infusion 20 you're not

176
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,760
going to find high levels anymore they're going to be but they're going to be continuously

177
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:07,120
coming out of the bone story so so they don't stop it at 20 they will go for the 40 treatments

178
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:14,880
so if you look at the million cvd deaths prevented in 2010 compared to 1968 in the us you see

179
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:25,160
a 32 percent decrease in cardiovascular disease and they think i'm sorry it's a 46 percent

180
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:30,480
reduction total of cardiovascular disease starting from that peak and then now it's

181
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,240
down to 2010 and they think a third of that is due to the decreased amounts of lead and

182
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:42,400
cadmium in the environment just from that alone and to prove that they've got 37 unique

183
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:49,680
studies and quite a few number of people and they have this is an enhanced study and they've

184
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:56,880
looked at all the different statistical things and so the rates in the us decreased 43 percent

185
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:03,160
and a third of that is basically the reduction in cardiovascular mortality could be explained

186
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:10,600
by the decline in lead and cadmium so there we definitely have lots of good epidemiological

187
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:16,760
data that lead and cadmium and cardiovascular disease are related now where do we get lead

188
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:23,480
in the 21st century well you know normally you get it from forest fires and volcanic

189
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:29,840
eruptions and spray of rock that has lead in it you know so it's very small amount but

190
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:39,600
then if i'm up to like 1975 they were putting in 273 times 10 to the 6 tons of lead just

191
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:47,040
from gas in the environment okay and and paint had some to do with it but mostly gas so during

192
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:54,160
1980 to 2012 there was a 91 percent reduction of lead in the environment so you can see

193
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,520
over to the far right the lead levels in the united states have gone down and in fact right

194
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:09,040
now they're between one and two is the average for adults so it's not the 14 that it was

195
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:18,200
in the 19 mid-1970s and probably higher in the 50s now of course occasionally lead falls

196
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:26,000
out of the sky in ways we didn't imagine when noter diam had that fire that burned the roof

197
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:35,480
off well 400 tons of lead rained down on paris and so there were 13 times higher than this

198
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:42,320
than the french safety guidelines and in a half mile or so in a mile they have if i had

199
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:48,520
this on where it was on demo mode it would show the the area around noter dame and and

200
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:54,120
how high the lead levels but more than 6 000 children younger than six live within a half

201
00:19:54,120 --> 00:20:04,960
of miles location so it was a disaster from a lead point of view okay let's see all right

202
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,320
then we have the sequela of the lead from the industrial age you can look at the over

203
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,880
that red stuff up in the northwest you want to plant something or have your cows eat something

204
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:21,260
there i mean the lead levels in the soil are just unbelievable and you can see colorado

205
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:25,160
has it that's probably leadville and all the mines and down in the southwest that's probably

206
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:30,440
all you know the the mines and stuff but we have a lot of industrial lead that's still

207
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:37,320
left over and in the soil waiting to approach us and in fact um they've looked at water

208
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:43,240
contamination and urban soil runoff and basically east coast west coast if you look at oakland

209
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:49,480
it's 100 parts per million and philadelphia has 400 parts per million and austin gardens

210
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,880
had over 400 parts per million that's where everybody goes they have the community gardens

211
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,120
where everybody goes and raises their food and when michelle obama had her kids garden

212
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:05,680
you know for the eating right stuff they had to add um um ground crab shells which bind

213
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:11,800
up the lead to help neutralize the toxicity so um well that's still a problem we have

214
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,800
to go with but sometimes the biggest problem is that the simplest solutions well turns

215
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:20,280
out lead binds to your bone right i mean we'll get to that in a minute but it does it binds

216
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:25,680
to the appetite and it becomes part of the bone where calcium is so they ground up um

217
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:32,880
fish bones and made these big sacks of 100 pound bags and and they detoxed oakland and

218
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:41,520
new orleans had published papers where they detoxed toxic sites and because if you put

219
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:48,160
so much as per square foot of topsoil you can lower the lead from 0.28 to 0.00085 like

220
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:53,960
in a couple weeks unbelievable and the thing about it they do it on playgrounds too because

221
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:59,400
the thing is is kids play in playgrounds and get all that dust and it's full of lead but

222
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:05,000
turns out fish appetite's not absorbable so if lead is bound to fish appetite and the

223
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:12,120
kid gets leaded you know lead in the in the dust that's bound to the appetite it it just

224
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:17,280
goes through them it doesn't hurt them so that's a pretty interesting solution so cheap

225
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:22,920
and easy so let's just go back to blood levels um there's blood lead levels and bone lead

226
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:27,160
levels and the blood lead levels are at the tip of the iceberg if you're back in the you

227
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:33,960
know 70s and the average blood lead level of an adult in the united states was 14 okay

228
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,960
well that reflects the last 30 to 60 days of exposure and half of it comes from bone

229
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,960
and half of it comes from the environment unless you're pregnant then 80 of it comes

230
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,920
from your blood lead level or it comes from your bone storage so most of the cdc inhain

231
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:52,520
studies that you read are talking about blood lead levels okay and that's what we measure

232
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:57,800
that's the standard now with blood lead levels bone lead levels are the iceberg okay not

233
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:03,560
the tip of it they're the whole iceberg here's here's this quick and easy thing to remember

234
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:09,720
if you breathe lead in the air or get it ingest it somehow 50 uh 50 percent of the stuff in

235
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:16,920
the air goes into your body and is absorbed and goes to the bloodstream 90 percent of

236
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:24,440
that settles in your bones over the next 90 uh 60 days or so so what we have is a bunch

237
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:30,200
of us running around that were born before 1980 that are full of lead and our bones have

238
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:38,520
like 400 000 times more lead than pre-metal man does i mean it's it's that and then what

239
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:47,320
the really bad part is is that when you start turning age 40 you and normal aging normative

240
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:54,720
aging happens and hormones change what happens is you dump out four to ten times faster so

241
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,480
your bone storage is turning over releasing all that lead and now guess what you don't

242
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:04,240
breathe it in your paint and you don't breathe it in your gas but now you have your own body

243
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:10,280
trying to dn because it's dumping all this lead and so if you go through chemo or have

244
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:17,120
hyperthyroidism or have anything that's catabolic you know how people get one thing and they

245
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,960
get 10 well that's what happens you just start dumping out so much lead that you become very

246
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:33,480
toxic very quick now the first land this was a landmark article was published in 2006 and

247
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:39,880
before that everybody thought anything below 10 was you know okay and and toxicity wasn't

248
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,960
you know even close to that so well what they this was the first one that looked at the

249
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:50,280
enhanced data in adults in america and it was about 15 000 people throughout america

250
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:57,360
in the um late 90s and what they showed was and this sounded bad at the time there was

251
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:05,960
a 25 percent in all cause mortality 55 percent in cv mortality 89 percent in mi mortality

252
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:12,040
and stroke went up under 51 percent in people that were in the um but here's the thing the

253
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:19,640
turtles were so tight then it was like if you were under like 1.8 and then it was like

254
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:26,120
1.8 to 3.2 and then 3.2 well whose blood lead level even goes i mean quest doesn't even

255
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:30,800
go at the time they didn't even go down to three i mean they went down to three or four

256
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:37,280
and lab core who's atomic numbers um they would go down they would go down to one so

257
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:42,040
and of course then there's error but anyway the bottom line is at this point they were

258
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:47,480
measuring lead levels that were so small nobody had any idea that they had this kind of vascular

259
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:53,360
effect well remember the bone lead is is the iceberg it's even worse and so they made a

260
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,920
bone density machine that measured lead and there's about 13 of them in the united states

261
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:02,400
because we should have them on every quarter and checking who who really is at risk whose

262
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:08,960
bones are at risk but anyway and they found it was 837 percent increase when adjusted

263
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,560
for age and smoking in people that were in the top tertile of bone lead so the more lead

264
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:20,800
you've been exposed to the more you have problems and this the real killer was last year or

265
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,280
i guess it was announced in two years when they published the extension study of that

266
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:34,160
inhain study and all of a sudden all-cause mortality went from 25 to 137 adjusted cv

267
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:42,880
mortality was ridiculous 170 the scheming mortality 208 and so but what they did is they used

268
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:49,680
a lot of interesting statistics and of all-cause mortality 18 of the population that dies per

269
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:58,480
year which and that year was 412 000 people was attributed to lead not cholesterol not

270
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:04,880
hyper 10 not all these other risk factors but to lead so this is another land i mean

271
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,840
this is a a landmark on top of a landmark okay and they they figure and through their

272
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:16,160
statistical stuff they figure you know 28 to 38 percent of cv and scheming mortality

273
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:23,120
are directly attributable to lead so other than the almost 20 year follow-up for these

274
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:28,960
14 000 people about a third of them have already died and 18 percent of that was

275
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,880
from lead and if you think about that that was 2.3 now we have and i don't know what's

276
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:41,520
happened in the last 10 years but now we have 2.8 million people who die a year which is

277
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:52,000
about 7778 people a day die so we you know that number of people die anyway but 18 percent

278
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,720
of that is due to lead this is other stuff that the nih trials which was a bone they

279
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,480
were the normative aging and they they used the bone density machine 44 percent of cataracts

280
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,840
people who lose a bunch of teeth i think it was eight people with osteoporosis people with pvd

281
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:18,000
cad gout brain shrinkage on mri renal insufficiency how fast you could walk in 10 other you know

282
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,080
parameters that they've looked at were all found to be higher in the higher tertile of lead

283
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:31,760
but they've published studies for about 20 years and there's there's hundreds of studies so my

284
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:38,000
case that i wanted to present tonight is this guy who was a construction company head and

285
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,240
and his brothers had all had problems in their 50s with heart disease but he was fine didn't

286
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,600
have any problem but he had a lot of lead exposure in his occupation so anyway he went to cardiologists

287
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,440
and said he wanted to you know be cat and they laughed at him and said well we'll do a stress

288
00:28:53,440 --> 00:29:00,560
test but you don't have anything wrong with you and so um other than the family history

289
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,640
he talked him into the stress test which i'll show you in a minute it was positive

290
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:13,440
path showed a 50 lesion with distal narrow lesion and he presented to me he wanted sodium edta

291
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:20,720
and um so i collected um serial leads after each 15 treatments that which was my protocol at the

292
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:29,200
time this cardiologist put him on a statin aspirin ace this was his initial um stress

293
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,600
test which he brought me and very nice you notice the little arrows he brought already

294
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,880
plugged the little tape already on the um on the thing in case i didn't know where that black line

295
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:46,480
was supposed to be and then um this was his cath with the 50 block and then the narrow distal thing

296
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:53,600
and then this is his um six or six or eight months later they did another stress test on him and all

297
00:29:53,600 --> 00:30:00,880
they're nice big red donuts there's no ischemic areas at all so he was my interesting case

298
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:07,280
uh and i showed that as i brought down the lead you know the lead came down as expected now i

299
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:15,120
was um i want to show you a couple slides because so we've got the we've got the the edta and

300
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:21,200
vascular disease right now this was a famous um he said he must have published like eight papers

301
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:29,120
and he's out of taiwan where they have a high um baseline lead levels um and so he took people

302
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,480
who had decreased creatinines but didn't have diabetes right and as you can see on the graph

303
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:40,320
he watches them for two years and watches their creatinine go down randomized but not treated

304
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,480
and then boom the group that's been randomized to treatment you see what happens they're the

305
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:50,480
ones on top there their um glomerular filtration doesn't go completely back to normal but it it

306
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:57,200
and it bursts up just like in a month you can see this incredible improvement in their renal um

307
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:02,080
perfusion and they go down at a very low rate over the next couple years the rest of them would go

308
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:12,000
on toward dilation or dialysis and so these at the time these were people that had um low level

309
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:20,720
24-hour urines um so they had elevated body burden but they weren't e p or um uh toxic by you know

310
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:27,680
the the different definitions definition at that time was 600 units and i've only seen that um in

311
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:33,120
one person in all my 25 years for 20 years doing this but so these were people that were greater

312
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,520
than 80 but less than 600 and they received treatments and when their lead levels would

313
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:42,160
start going back up or their urine lead levels they'd start chelating them again so these people

314
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:48,400
were continuously intermittently chelated over two three years and so you can see what happened to

315
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:54,960
them and um the new england journal um said at the time they said well we don't know that it's due

316
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:02,720
to chelation of lead but we sure know that it's due to edta chelation i mean they were very uh and

317
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:09,280
and the difference in cost for the guys that are um on that bottom row were the cost dialysis at

318
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:18,880
the time was 63 000 dollars compared to 3 300 for the years of chelation i mean actual cost and so

319
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:26,640
it was like a 95 reduction in cost of care so i mean there's a lot of interesting cost data that

320
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:32,560
i see i think this we know that glomerular filtration works on nitroxide so i think

321
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:39,680
this is an example and this is using calcium edta not sodium and i personally am not i don't

322
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:45,840
believe there's a big difference so the bottom line is um this was calcium edta and it caused

323
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:51,440
a lot of improvement in glomerular filtration through nitroxide now he went ahead and published

324
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:57,120
this seven more times there's seven or eight more times and so you know i think we have plenty of

325
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:04,480
data now showing that edta treatment not only slows ckd progression and it may not even be related to

326
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:13,040
directly to lead but here's the um i'm missing a slide now i guess i'll show that slide later

327
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:18,080
and then this was that paper that um where neurotoxicity and treatment with edta

328
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:24,160
and a lot of different things that are direct neurotoxins okay beside metals and then indirect

329
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:31,600
agents that cause cytokine or ros species production and then the ones that develop the oh gosh what is

330
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:41,040
it um it's the lymphocyte 19 or 17 um species of t cell that then cause allergies and cause metal

331
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:46,400
allergies through immunotherapy so now there's 21 metals that are considered toxic they're listed

332
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:55,040
there the ones highlighted are the most uh related to um i believe cardiovascular or to um to uh

333
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:04,160
neurotoxicity so we talk about toxic metal burden and we know it's been proven already in in ms and

334
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:09,200
a lot of different neurodegenerative diseases like parkinson's and alzheimer's that if you look at

335
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:17,680
the toxic metal burden um it's much higher in those with neurological disease than people

336
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:24,160
that are um healthy controls and so there's a really good article it's recent and it has um a

337
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:35,040
lot of um this one and the one before have a lot of um up-to-date references so basically they're

338
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:43,920
saying that if you eliminate toxins if you correct your lifestyle and then you get rid of these

339
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:51,200
metals with chelation you have an excellent option to ameliorate symptoms of a neurotoxicity

340
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:57,680
and and whether it's metal induced for cardiovascular or whether it's neurological

341
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,160
or whether it's kidney here's what happens you have redox you have increased production

342
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:11,520
um cytokines and and decreased nitric oxide and then those cause the oxidation the endothelial

343
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:17,040
injury the vasoconstriction all the things that we see in heart disease so there's no reason that

344
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:23,360
edta will i mean the edta has been proven to work on all these different things and so it's a good

345
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:30,800
choice when you've got these broad diseases like cardiovascular neurogenetic degenerative diseases

346
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:38,640
uh to hit it with a you know a little bit of edta all right and so this is the nitric oxide

347
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:48,720
mechanism um directly direct correlation between um nitric oxide and um and uh lead levels so the

348
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:54,640
higher the lead levels the lower the nitric oxide and then this is the study i like because this is

349
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:01,040
this is what i want pushed into me if i ever go into surgery um these rats these lead-free rats

350
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:07,520
were um treated with eta 30 minutes before the real arteries were clamped and then of course they

351
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:13,680
didn't survive and so their histochemical and functional testing was performed so in the

352
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:23,840
pre-treated rats their um nos expression and their nitric oxide was higher they had decreased um

353
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:30,000
inflammatory things like tnf alpha and mac1 adhesion molecules but these had this had nothing

354
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:37,600
to do with the lead this had to do with the function of edta on nitric oxide so very interesting

355
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:46,080
mechanism this is um a study that was published uh gosh when was it published um around 2009

356
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:54,800
and they took about like eight or nine different edta or um assays and did it on these people

357
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:02,320
before and after i think it was 20 treatments and bottom line 20 reduction in oxidation 34

358
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:10,240
reduction in dna damage so a good thing for aging no matter what it's from so the other thing i want

359
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,000
to talk to about tonight if we have time is issues to consider right now we've got all these new

360
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,960
compounding rules and people making rules about how you can't put so you can't you personally can't

361
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:26,240
put more than three things in some states in a bag in texas they just don't enforce it and then

362
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:32,080
time considerations and then there are some people there you know promoting these oral and

363
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:37,520
suppository forms well i was going to tell you about the compounding rules um if you're they vary

364
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:42,880
from state to state it's usually three items this is what's in the tag trial right now we mix this

365
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,720
up ourselves but in the future in the near future you're not going to be able to do that you're

366
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,720
going to have to have a pharmacist do it and it'll have to be a compounding pharmacist it'll be a

367
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:57,120
lot of extra money i went back and taught i actually talked to um elmer crann through the

368
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:04,400
email he's like 88 now and he said that go back and look his original protocols where they just

369
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:10,160
used disodium edta adjusted to creatinine clearance and then use an isotonic solution like

370
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:16,400
d5 or half normal and then if they had pain up to 200 milligrams of lidocaine well that's good

371
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,440
because that the the ivy solution counts as one thing and then there's the two more so you can

372
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:26,400
get by the compounding rules if you just do this and have them take high dose oral

373
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:34,720
high dose oral vitamins so this is this may be i mean this is not the a cam protocol this is crann

374
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:42,720
but he was part of a cam and it may end up being what saves us from the um the um compounding rules

375
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:50,560
i have a history and physical for lead this got me a um when that 2006 article was published i was

376
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:58,080
like okay this lead toxicity is recognized now i'm going to bill and a lot of them were to medicare

377
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:05,440
patients and i got a nice little audit from the integrity auditors um in 2009 and i thought i was

378
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,000
going to die but anyway i hadn't developed this nice little heavy metal for lead and it has all

379
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:16,400
the things that are in the atsdr and the cdc and the normative aging study and basically i was able

380
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,520
to document if they had a lead level over two that it was okay to bill and it got signed off by

381
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:28,720
doctors at medicare which is amazing and uh anyway so for many years we've you know billed and using

382
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:37,920
this form um then i want to mention one other guy who's probably we all need to thank his name is

383
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:45,680
ray evers he was a chelating physician in alabama and he's the one that got us um the right to use

384
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:52,320
um the right to use drugs that once they were fda approved for something you could use them off

385
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,520
label for anything you wanted to and and there's only one that i know of that you can't do that

386
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:03,200
with and that's growth hormone and that's in some 1970s thing in congress but anyway he won this

387
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:08,960
precedent and um you know once they're after you they're after you he ended up he treated all

388
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:14,400
degenerative diseases with relation but back then they weren't as good about you know the doses and

389
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:20,480
everything and i think he had some severe adverse effects and he lost his license but anyway we still

390
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:27,280
need to pay homage to this man because if it is published if it's used anything and it's fda

391
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:35,360
approved you have the right to use it in your in your practice now these are just three pages

392
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:42,240
of these are all that these are on tac2.org starting from the design of the first TAC trial

393
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:48,160
up to all these heavy metal and environmental contaminants these are great articles if you're

394
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:53,760
bored and you just want to really dig into them they're all there free on that site for you

395
00:40:53,760 --> 00:41:02,960
and with that i am done all right dr green uh do you yep yep do you want me to pull up your

396
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:13,360
presentation sir oh i think you might be muted sir sorry about that okay here we go yeah

397
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:26,640
all right so we got a uh a history of chelation and and its use in 45 minutes that's that's great

398
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:34,080
um now i there were own actually there were only a couple of questions um and we have a little

399
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:41,040
more time but actually because there's only um a few questions is was there anything else that you

400
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:48,880
just wanted to mention that you um maybe thought you didn't have time to bring up yeah what i'd

401
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,120
like to do is get people because part of the thing about chelation part of the thing that i

402
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:58,640
liked about a cam even 20 years ago when i went for the first time was the camaraderie of the

403
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:03,440
group and how we all share things what i'd really like to do is start doing a series of these little

404
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:09,040
things where we get like i want to do the next topic on retained bullets because that's a really

405
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:14,800
interesting topic i have tons of people that have been blasted you know with 130 pellets and these

406
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:23,440
hunting accidents hey you know it's texas anyway um and um and they're really hard to treat because

407
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:29,280
they have they won't take these bullets out and i want to find an interventionist um that will

408
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,880
you know use a little suction device and get those things out because they say that they're

409
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:39,840
enclosed but that's baloney i've never seen anybody with less than a 12 uh chronic lead level if you

410
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:46,080
have bullets yeah and so i want to get you know ask the community if they'd like to you know

411
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:53,040
do you know uh anybody who has cases like that let's have an evening i'll do like a 10 minute

412
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:58,880
little thing about you know the history and bullets and extractions and blah blah blah

413
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,520
and then let's present some cases and what people have done because i'm oh yeah i've got some really

414
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:10,080
great cases and i i'm ham hamstring how to get the lead level down well it would be good to do

415
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:17,360
a series of case presentations in general not just uh you know i mean i'm going to do a couple

416
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:25,360
quick ones here before we get to the questions um um do i click next jason yeah you can just hit

417
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:33,760
next to the bottom of the screen okay um and okay so here these are two patients i mean i've been

418
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:40,800
doing chelation for 32 years and for a variety of reasons um in this patient um i presented them at

419
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:48,640
the at the conferences he was an 81 year old when he came to see me uh with both documented coronary

420
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:56,880
and peripheral vascular disease and in in his case i was using the ankle brachial index which is a

421
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:02,960
simple test where you're measuring blood pressure between the upper extremity and

422
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:12,240
and the arm and the lower extremity and when you compare the systolic blood pressure you can see

423
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:20,160
you get a ratio and normal is 0.9 to 1.3 um moderate a mile to moderate is when it goes down

424
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:29,120
when you have a bigger gradient there and then severe is less than 0.4 and so you can see before

425
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:37,120
i treated him with a course of sodium edta and i just gave nine treatments before we

426
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:46,240
uh tested his ankle brachial index and you can see that in his uh on his right arm on the right side

427
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:56,480
he was 0.73 before and 0.98 so he was he had moderate disease um prior to treatments and it

428
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:02,240
went to normal and on that was not quite as much on the left but you can see here this was a simple

429
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:12,800
test didn't require anything invasive um and he didn't do that many treatments um before uh he

430
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:20,160
showed clinical improvement as well as laboratory improvement and the next case i thought uh i'd

431
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:28,960
share with here um is a patient who's still still with me he um came at when i first started

432
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:39,840
treating him uh he was 76 he had both wet and dry macular degeneration i um did a provocative

433
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:47,200
chelation challenges with him um both um with uh let's see i have to get rid of my picture and

434
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:57,280
so i can see the results um there if you thank you yeah good okay so um

435
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:06,880
so um so in his six-hour chelation urine challenge um he you could see that he they although the test

436
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,680
measured many metals though i only mentioned the ones here that were abnormally elevated

437
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:20,960
and you can see he probably had a number of mris in his life where he was given gadolinium as a

438
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:28,880
tracer and uh and you can see he had a very high level normal is less than 0.5 um but after 20

439
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:37,280
treatments with edta a post treatment a post cap challenge they didn't um there was they couldn't

440
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:44,800
find any so that was pretty amazing and you know i still think there's an a dearth of knowledge

441
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:50,880
a dearth of knowledge about what all this gadolinium is doing in our system i once had a patient

442
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:58,240
who had one mri 20 years prior to his uh provocative challenge and had very high levels

443
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:04,960
of gadolinium so this tends to stick into our in our in our tissues and um and i'm glad that

444
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:11,760
finally radiologists are recognizing this and are trying to avoid using gadolinium as much as they

445
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:20,640
used to they were very cavalier about its use in the past here cadmium was elevated and uh and and

446
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:28,320
lead um were all elevated um he's actually this this probably should be updated with uh because

447
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:33,360
he's had a number more of chelations over the years he's done a lot of things with me um in his

448
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:44,000
in his care now on the right side um we also um did um looked for mercury and um he he uh through

449
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:55,600
a dmps challenge um had elevated mercury in his urine and um he did a number of dmps treatments

450
00:47:55,600 --> 00:48:03,360
as well as oral dmsa three times a week um and and you can see that his mercury came down so

451
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:10,800
you know this is just evidence his macular degeneration actually halted and um whereas

452
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:19,520
it had been increasingly getting worse prior to the time that uh he saw me it it quickly arrested

453
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:25,520
and plateaued in its severity and then more recently now um he actually has had slight

454
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:34,320
improvement in his macular degeneration so these are the two cases that i uh have and back to

455
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:44,800
darthi so i'm going to um there was a question here let me look at the questions um

456
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:53,760
um well someone asked a very technical question about the the binding uh constants of edta

457
00:48:54,560 --> 00:49:02,720
of do you have that at the top of your yeah i do and in vitro and in vivo are different um

458
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:10,080
they're um those those are in uh with um cranton's book and i have them as part of

459
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:16,160
a presentation if somebody really wants them but the the thing is is it's not only the binding

460
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:24,960
pk values it is how present it is so something like manganese may not have a very high binding

461
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:32,400
but when you do you'll see tons of manganese because it's and magnesium and calcium you'll

462
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:39,440
see tons of that because it's there okay and there's a lot of it but um some things like you

463
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:50,560
think would have um better binding like mercury don't and so yeah you can't the pk is important

464
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:56,400
but remember that's an in vitro thing and in vivo it's it's different yeah yeah it's like

465
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:02,800
one plus one doesn't always equal two okay yeah that's a i'm going to try to keep it a little

466
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,960
more clinical the questions we're going to do in the time we have left we have 10 minutes left

467
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:17,280
um how long do i have to wait before getting a bmp after an ivy edta treatment a basic metabolic

468
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:22,880
profile i guess that's what he's asking yeah i would wait um three to seven days because if you

469
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:28,720
have damage it's interstitial damage okay and it's not going to be you know like the artery got

470
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:36,640
severed it's going to take a few days and so um i i know these people that back you know

471
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:42,480
10 20 years ago when they were pushing ivy you know just doing ivy pushes of the calcium you

472
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,400
can't do it with sodium it'll kill somebody but they were doing it with the calcium but the thing

473
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:54,400
is is that the toxicity of edta has to do with how bad it interstitially bothers the kidneys

474
00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:00,240
and so i know one guy he's he's treating like a lead guy you know one of the guys that has 130

475
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:12,560
pellets in him he does um 250 milligrams of glutathione ivy push after he ivy pushes basically

476
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:21,040
calcium and he does it once or twice a week and that my patient has his his credit hadn't bumped

477
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:28,480
one bit so i don't know all the things that protect the kidneys you know we know that nac

478
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:33,760
is an antioxidant that protects the kidneys against toxins so and i always give my patients

479
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:39,200
nac when they're chelating because it does protect their kidneys and it's also a chelator too

480
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:50,000
you know i'm using the the the equation to calculate your dose of edta i mean if you

481
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:57,280
adjust your dose based on your kidney function then you should be safe with that and that's

482
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:04,080
generally been you know there have been only maybe twice in my whole career of many tens of

483
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:11,760
thousands of treatments where somebody's creatinine went up had any kind of a significant bump up

484
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,880
because of chelation if you and it's not real tight you know we use that equation but

485
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:22,480
i've also seen people who just do it based on because on every lab thing now you have a

486
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:31,280
gfr right and so they just base it you know if it's ckd2 you know you do quarter you know i mean

487
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:36,400
they reduce it proportionally and that's easier than putting it into a big equation like people

488
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:42,560
used to someone asked me someone asked me the question what what is the minimum gfr that you

489
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:47,440
would um that would be the cutoff before you would stop doing chelation

490
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:56,320
or not do chelation under well okay as an inexperienced person probably

491
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:04,880
you know um 25 or 30 but as you get more experienced hey they do it to dialysis patients

492
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:09,440
that's how how do you think these dialysis patients got on dialysis they were lead toxic

493
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:14,960
their kidneys created out and now they've done studies where you start the dialysis and you

494
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:21,360
give the edta and it's flushing around in there and it dumps out a whole bunch of lead and so

495
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:27,920
and so you're not going to hurt a dialysis patient right um you're not going to kill their kidneys

496
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,640
so it's very interesting and some of the protocols that people have come up with

497
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:39,040
to do that i would you know what i would do um if if they were really really you know like below

498
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:46,800
20 25 percent that's where i would use the lower dose suppositories or the oral edta not because

499
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:52,560
of methyl binding but because of the nitric oxide effect and so smaller amounts that don't hurt

500
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:57,200
your kidneys may help you with the nitric oxide part and if you have that kidneys then that's a

501
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:03,920
good yeah yeah we call it chelation therapy but there are other mechanisms of action obviously

502
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:10,880
in in in how they work these different chelating agents um and here is a question can you discuss

503
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:18,240
the efficacy of oral dmsa or suppository edta compared to ivy and if it can be used you know i

504
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:24,720
obviously um we we don't use dnsa and edta interchangeably but i'll answer that question

505
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:33,280
well dmsa is a good metal binder and it's it's fda approved i think to bind the fda approved

506
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:39,840
level of in kids a 45 lead level who has that anymore except paint eat chip eating kids and

507
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:48,480
you know few places but anyway um you can use it a lot cranty i i got a lot of my early training

508
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:55,040
you know from from crant calling talking to crant but um and and then crinian had a paper about

509
00:54:55,040 --> 00:55:02,320
the day after you do edta and you have all this extra lead floating around you need something to

510
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:08,800
bind it up and so i would you know one of the things i offer people is to take um edta like

511
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:15,760
three times i'm sorry dmsa three times a week like 500 250 to 500 milligrams three times a week

512
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:20,640
you know in addition to doing the edta now there's one paper a friend of mine out in

513
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:26,080
california rita elthorpe who's involved who's going to become involved with a cam 2 published

514
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:32,640
a paper um and they use edta but they use the suppositories but they use it in a um phospholipid

515
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:38,560
long acting delivery system so you pop it in at night it works for eight hours well it's sitting

516
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:42,960
there working for eight hours and then the metal that they collected on that one was

517
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:50,640
three repositories um was equivalent to an ivy i find that hard to believe but they published it

518
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:56,560
and it looks legit yeah i don't think the short-acting ones do that and i don't think

519
00:55:56,560 --> 00:56:05,360
the oral it's only absorbed five percent well you know it's also good to remember that that the

520
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:11,520
liver also filters the metal chelate complex then gets into bile and it's excreted through stool

521
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:18,400
and so you also want to make sure that people's valves are working well and that you know they're

522
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:25,680
not too constipated um and and you can add i mean one of my questions was you know what do you give

523
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:33,840
your patients as as supplements to to complement chelation um you know i i guess i can say that

524
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:40,960
with this isn't seeing me i can yeah i when i started with a long time ago and i was just stuck

525
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:45,760
with him i tried other things but i've gone back to him there's a company near boston called cure

526
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:51,840
encapsulations and i use their ultra nutrient because it has all the methylated bees all the

527
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:58,720
bees are methylated has the max number of antioxidants and it has about 16 herbs and spices

528
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:04,960
but i'm i'm kidding i mean it has coq and alphalepoic and it has um silmarian and and um

529
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:11,600
ginger and and you know it just has a whole bunch of everything that people need and it's always

530
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:16,880
worked for my patients and i give them that and i give them two nac 600 milligrams a day

531
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:22,400
and anything else that they need based on their disease state but that's the basic thing that way

532
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:27,200
they get their methylated oh and i've always given that a week before i do the challenge because i

533
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:32,960
found a lot of people their methylation pathways aren't working and so they don't dump their metals

534
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:38,560
but boy you get the methylation pathways working with support with nac methyl folate methyl b12

535
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:50,160
and whatever way you want to get it and they don't metal like crazy so that's my thing someone um

536
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:58,320
asked if you combine chelation and ozone therapy together a lot of people do i i've gone and trained

537
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:04,720
i haven't done it i've gotten it myself i love it i mean i love ozone but in the state of texas they

538
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:12,160
were really anti um alternative medicine and when i quoted the new england journal article in a

539
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:19,920
article in a in a um an ad and and and had a little star with the the thing to the new england

540
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:26,400
journal article and and showed the graph and said these have a potential 95 reduction in cost so

541
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:32,240
there's there's great interest from an you know you'll see her viewpoint of you of seeing if this

542
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:37,760
works i got a three thousand dollar fine in my first dink from the state board and then they kept

543
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:42,960
then they kept coming after me and coming after me until you know i finally joined the tac trial

544
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:48,800
you know because it was like okay i can be a wolf in sheep's clothing here and um the the and and

545
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:55,440
the head crack buster in the united states because by then you had to tell who was coming after you

546
00:58:55,440 --> 00:59:01,200
um had me going up there again and this time it wasn't just for advertising it was for

547
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:10,160
medical you know necessity and by then i had won the medicare thing and the tac trial was

548
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:16,080
going to be published the next week and i said you guys are going to look real bad next week

549
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:21,280
i can't tell you what's in the article but you're going to look really bad if you find that this is

550
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:27,600
not medically necessary i'm going to quickly ask one more question only because it it's been an

551
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:34,800
it it's been an hour and an hour goes by very quickly uh uh someone said that could you quickly

552
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:40,720
go over the basic frequency and duration of treatments intervals between treatments how

553
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:51,120
many total um what if so the old a cam protocol for um cardiovascular was 40 and just that's what

554
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:56,800
people found worked and though that's what they replicated in the trial what's interesting is

555
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:04,080
chapelle and so published a paper comparing the outcomes of tac to the outcomes of their

556
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:12,160
retrospective study and their people had an average of 58 treatments they had almost no mi

557
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:18,560
so it wasn't just a 51 percent reduction and much better by doing more treatments that goes along

558
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:23,840
with the normative aging thing that says it's all in our bones so you can chelate it out and do 40

559
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:28,880
but in two or three years it's going to be coming back yeah my protocol for people that don't have

560
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:37,600
super high levels is i do 15 now and then i do one a month um and until just forever because

561
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:41,360
until their lead levels stay down because it's always going to be coming out of your bones and

562
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:51,520
it's going to be coming out faster so why not be there to stop it out for metal uh i monitor for

563
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:58,080
metal overload once we get down to what is considered normal levels i'll tell the patient

564
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:04,320
to do maintenance therapy but but sometimes they they you know they're tired of it they just want

565
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:10,240
to stop coming and maybe two or three or four years later they come back and you do a provocative

566
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:15,360
challenge and you'll see sometimes the levels go have gone up again because they they have they

567
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:22,560
kind of uh diffused out of the the darker deeper recesses and in the tissues so it's it's it is a

568
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:30,480
lifelong uh project well i bought a um a clinic when i was first starting this and where the doctor

569
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:35,040
had a stroke and he was doing it basically his wife was running the clinic basically while he

570
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:39,520
was bedridden at home so i took over his clinic but this clinic had been and it was the first one

571
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:46,880
in houston it was called the macguff clinic and um it had been back since the 60s right and all

572
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:52,320
the um and and so the i heard stories and stories of these people who you know yeah they did their

573
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:56,880
40 and then two or three years later they were back with angina again and then they did their 40

574
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:01,840
and then they found out that they just came in once every month or two then they never had another

575
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:06,560
problem they never had another procedure they never had another stent and it was true and so

576
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:12,240
it just at the same time that the normative aging study was coming out and so it just dovetailed

577
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:19,920
beautifully into what we know well i think this is where we're gonna end the webinar

578
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:28,000
um i want to thank you so much for preparing this dot and for the people who attended um
